Group Meeting:
3/13/18

Tentative Design:
  - A simple query page leads to a results screen
      - Query page has large picture based buttons that generalize user input
      - Results page has a google maps on the left, and a list of cities on the right
  - Once this simple design is finished, we can work on adding:
      - An advanced query option
      - Clicking on a city in the list on the right will change the map on the left
      - A filter/requery panel on the left of the results page to redefine the query

Starting/Easiest User Inputs:
  - population (census.gov api)
  - ethnic demographics (census.gov api)
  - red / blue counties (https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16)
  - weather (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) 

Action Points:
  - Steve is working with Daniel to figure out frontend to backend communication
  - Elizabeth and Kaitlyn are going to meet the customer on Wedneday (3/14)
  - Kaitlyn is finishing SRS 
  - Both frontend and backend will work on very simple prototype to give to customer:
      - Query page with 1 button or text box for population
      - Results page with google maps and 1 resulting city
      - Backend will query census.gov (or different api) to get 1 city that meets population query and return it to frontend
