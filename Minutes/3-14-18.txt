Dr. Nicholas approved the Design and Requirements.

Main Goals:
  - Pick a few inputs and do them well. Doing so desmonstrates that we can do all the other inputs with more resources and time. 
  - A well designed, simple UI that works well is better than a sophisticated UI. 
  - Focus on size, cost, climate, and red/blue. 

Notes:
  - Images of cities is not required, but is a nice touch. 
  - We don't need to focus on crime. Crime is often correlated with property values/real estate prices, so we just need to do property values to capture that data.
  - He liked the google maps arrows/points. 
  - He liked the idea of a simple input page first, with more advanced features added later. 
  - He suggested we roleplay the UI to figure out how it would work best. 
  - We will send him the finished requirements document to sign/approve as soon as Cain lets us know what to do.
      - He prefers attachments to be pdfs.
